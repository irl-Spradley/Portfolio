# Aloha!
My name is Alejandro, I'm a Design Systems Integrator and I love to create software deployments. I love to deploy painfully complicated CADD software to my users. I also love the method of deploying software with everything that the user needs to start the software and knock out production seamlissly without taking over their machines.

Here I would showcase you some of my work that I've created to help deploy software that will be easily manageible if updates, licenses, and permissions become an issue.


## Input Language: PowerShell

## Tools
<summary><h3>The tool that I use for my firm to deploy software is called Immybot. Immybot primarely uses powershell to allow me to deploy software with custom installs tailored to the user or discipline. Immybot also allows us to onboard new machines and install assigned software to the user.</summary></h3>

## Why?
<summary><h3>Majority of the software that I deploy require licenses and custom configured CADD profiles for Autodesk that other tools cannot simply do (Intune). With the proper configuration I can deploy a software with the proper licesense and profile to allow the engineer to load up a project and have all the tools to view a .dwg or project just like their peers.</summary></h3>

## Software Examples 
<summary><h3> As I continue my journey you will be able to see what kind of software I deploy and why I do so. Autodesk has many applications that I deploy to my users. Civil 3D, MEP, and Revit will be deployed with my firms profile which intails tool spaces, blocks, linetypes, plotting styles, pipe networks, palettes, boarders, and catalogs that will help the users view the project the same as their client or peers. Other examples like SKM Power Tools will have renamed folders for easy identification on what version the user has installed and registry edits for shared licenses tied to the software. </summary></h3>

## Extras
<summary><h3> I will also showcase "cleanup scripts" and tricks that will help clear out any profile and config errors that you may encounter when loading up any Autodesk custom profile that my collegue has developed along the way. </summary></h3>

## Heads up!
<summary><h3> Majority of the Powershell scripts showcased here are tailed to Immybot. But you should be able to understand the tool and tailor it to your use. I will provide more information about Immybot if you're curious what else this tool can do.
